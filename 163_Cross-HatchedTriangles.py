163 Cross-Hatched Triangles

Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1 triangle in the sketch below.

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2 triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that size 2 triangle.

It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n2 size 1 triangle building blocks.

If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size n, then

T(1) = 16
T(2) = 104

Find T(36).

Solution Method:
1. Create an index matrix that translates x-y coordinates into an index for adjacency matrices
2. Create 6 adjacency matrices for each of the six directions
3. For each ad. matrix, create edges between every pair of vertices in the same subgraph
4. Remove reflexive edges - edges with the same start and end point
5. Take every permutation of 3 ad. matrices and multiply them together
6. Find the trace of each product and sum the result
7. Divide by 6 - this is the solution

This method works because the product of adjacency matrices tells you the number of paths from one vertex to another. You multiply permutations of ad. matrices because this ensures you don't count any paths that double-back on themselves. These ad. matrices don't have reflexive edges because you don't want to count "paths" that stay put at a vertex. However, when you finally take the trace of an ad. matrix product, you're counting the number of length-3 paths that start and stop at the same vertex - i.e. triangles. The answer is divided by six because each triangle was counted 6 times - 3 times starting at each vertex and 2 times more for clockwise and counter-clockwise.
