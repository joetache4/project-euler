686 Powers Of Two

2^7=128 is the first power of two whose leading digits are "12".
The next power of two whose leading digits are "12" is 280.

Define p(L,n) to be the nth-smallest value of j such that the base 10 representation of 2^j begins with the digits of L. So p(12,1)=7 and p(12,2)=80.

You are also given that p(123,45)=12710.

Find p(123,678910).

Solution Method

Solve for m in 10^m = 2^n. So m = n*log(2,10).

Let x be the leading digits.
Let d be length(str(x)) - 1 (the exponent in the scientific notation of x).

Then, x * 10^(floor(m)-d) <= 2^n <= (x+1) * 10^(floor(m)-d).
Take log_10 of all sides to get
floor(m) + log(x) - d <= m <= floor(m) + log(x+1) - d.

Iterate n and see which fulfill the above inequalities.
