027 Quadratic Primes

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n^2+n+41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0≤n≤39. However, when n=40,40^2+40+41=40(40+1)+41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41, 41^2+41+41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n^2−79n+1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0≤n≤79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

    n^2+an+b, where |a|<1000 and |b|≤1000

where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n, e.g. |11|=11 and |−4|=4.

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.

# Additionally, b > -n^2-an. Using calculus to find the maximum of f(n) = -n^2-an,
# see that b > a^2/4.
