684 Inverse Digit Sum

Define s(n) to be the smallest number that has a digit sum of n. For example s(10)=19.
Let S(k)=∑n,1,k,s(n). You are given S(20)=1074.

Further let fi be the Fibonacci sequence defined by f[0]=0,f[1]=1 and f[i]=f[i−2]+f[i−1] for all i≥2.

Find ∑i,2,90,S(f[i]). Give your answer modulo 1000000007.

Solution Method

S is built up from previous two results, similar to the method of calculating fibanocci numbers.

The key is the shift() method, which takes a cumulative S(n) and returns S(n + offset) - S(offset). (See the S() method to understand why shift() works.)

This is used to calculate S(f[n]) = S(f[n-1] + f[n-2]).
