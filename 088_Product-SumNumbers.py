088 Product-Sum Numbers

A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak.

For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.

For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.

k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2
k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4
k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2
k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6

Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.

What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12000?

Solution Method

2k is a product-sum number for size k. Note that sum(1,...,1,2,k) = prod(1,...,1,2,k) = 2k
where "1,...1" is a sequence of (k-2) ones.

All product-sum numbers n for a given size k follow n = prod(F) = sum(F) + k - len(F),
where F is a fact of n into prime or composite numbers.

So, any given n is a product-sum number of size k = prod(F) - sum(F) + len(F).
