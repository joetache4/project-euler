066 Diophantine Equation

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

x2 – Dy2 = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 – 13×1802 = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

32 – 2×22 = 1
22 – 3×12 = 1
92 – 5×42 = 1
52 – 6×22 = 1
82 – 7×32 = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.

Observations

This is Pell's equation.
	See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell's_equation
My original solution method involved the convergents of the continued fraction for sqrt(n).
	See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Infinite_continued_fractions_and_convergents
	However, sqrt(n) has limited precision, making the fraction inaccurate after about 20 - #digits(n) iterations. This was insufficient to solve certain numbers, starting with D=61.
My final, working solution method involves the Chakravala Method.
	See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakravala_method
	1. Start with a triplet (a, b, k) s.t. a^2 -nb^2 = k and gcd(a,b)=1
	2. Choose positive int m s.t. (a+bm)/k is an int and abs(m^2 - n) is minimized
	3. "Compose" (a,b,k) with (m,1,m^2-n) to get a new triplet
	4. Divide the new triplet by the old k (Bhaskara's Lemma)
	5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a triplet with k=1 is found
