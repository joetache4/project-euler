246 Tangents To An Ellipse

A definition for an ellipse is:
Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that d(G,M)<r, the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an ellipse.
The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.

Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).
Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.
The locus of the points that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.
From a point P outside e the two tangents t1 and t2 to the ellipse are drawn.
Let the points where t1 and t2 touch the ellipse be R and S.

For how many lattice points P is angle RPS greater than 45 degrees?

	***

Solution method:

1.	Calculate angle for arbitrary point.

	Solve y(t)-Py / x(t)-Px  =  dy/dt / dx/dt  for t where x(t) and y(t) are the parametric equations for an ellipse. Eventually requires solving asin(t) + bcos(t) = c, which is done by dividing through by sqrt(a**2  +b**2). It becomes sin(B)sin(t) + cos(B)cos(t) = d  where B = atan(a/b). Use trig identity to get cos(t-B) = d  ->  t = +-acos(d) + atan(a/b) + 2n*pi.

	Use both t's to find tangent points. May need to add pi to a t if it's on the wrong side of the ellipse. Use law of cosines to get angle.

2.	Crawl around the grid marking a boundary where the angle is < 45deg.

3.	Count the size of this boundary

	The method to do this assumes the boundary is convex. It finds the difference between min and max heights of visited points in each column, and summing these differences.

Notes:

* 	equation for foci of ellipse: F**2 = M**2 - m**2  (F=dist from foci to center, M=semi-major axis, m=semi-minor axis)
* 	ellipse equation: (x/M)**2 + (y/m)**2 = 1
* 	parametric equation: x(t) = Mcos(t)  y(t) = msin(t)
