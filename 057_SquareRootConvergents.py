057 Square Root Convergents

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

2–√=1+12+12+12+…

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

1+12=32=1.5
1+12+12=75=1.4
1+12+12+12=1712=1.41666…
1+12+12+12+12=4129=1.41379…


The next three expansions are 9970
, 239169, and 577408, but the eighth expansion, 1393985

, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

dig = lambda n: len(str(n))

count = 0
n = 1
d = 1
for i in range(1000):
	n, d = 2*d + n, d + n
	if dig(n) > dig(d):
		count += 1
print(count)
